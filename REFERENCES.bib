	abstract = {A procedure is given for estimating the size of a closed population in the presence of heterogeneous capture probabilities using capture-recapture data when it is possible to model the capture probabilities of individuals in the population using covariates. The results include the estimation of the parameters associated with the model of the capture probabilities and the use of these estimated capture probabilities to estimate the population size. Confidence intervals for the population size using both the asymptotic normality of the estimator and a bootstrap procedure for small samples are given.},
